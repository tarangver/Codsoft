# ELISA - Simple Rule-Based ChatBOT 🤖💬

This project is a **simple rule-based chatbot** named **ELISA**, created using Python. It mimics basic conversational interaction based on pre-defined keyword matching and responses.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot matches user input against a list of predefined rules (questions or phrases). If a match is found, the corresponding response is returned. If not, a default fallback message is shown.

---

## 🗂️ Features

- Greets the user and handles basic conversational queries  
- Responds to common phrases like "Hello", "What is your name?", etc.  
- Ends the conversation on input like "exit" or "bye"  
- Uses simple string matching for logic (no NLP libraries involved)

| Any other input                  | I'm sorry, I don't have information about that. |
