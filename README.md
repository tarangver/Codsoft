# CodSoft Internship Projects

This repository contains three projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. Each task demonstrates practical use of Python, logic building, and basic machine learning concepts.

- *Note: For this internship, I was required to complete 3 out of 5 projects. I have completed Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4.*
